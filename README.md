### [retro game]
The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle consisting of three rods and a number of disks of various diameters, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle was invented by the French mathematician Ã‰douard Lucas and first presented in 1883 as a game. The puzzle begins with the disks stacked on one rod in order of decreasing size; the objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to one of the other rods.
